This project is about delivery food. I mainly collected the cost, when did I order it, the food type, the arrival time. To visualize the data, I use the "bowl" and "sun" to represent the food and time. The bars below the bowl represents how long it takes to arrive.

During my coding process, the biggest challenge for me is to determine the location of different shapes. There are several data groups, each has a similar location but still have difference, so I cannot use the same function. This time I rewrite several similar functions but it takes up more space.

Another challenge for me is to draw images, since d3 can only draw simple shapes like circles and rectangles. I used Illustrator to draw different height of "rice" and it turns out to be successful, but when it comes to the cover and back, I found it was hard to locate these custom shapes.

For this project, my biggest takeaway is that now I'm really familiar with d3, including its groups, classes, the dataset and so on. And it's really great to see my own data get visualized!
