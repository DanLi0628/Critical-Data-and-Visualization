Simple intro:
Every time people go to Disneyland, they complain about the long waiting time. Have you ever thought about what period of the year or which day in a week will attract more people? Have a look at this visualization and better plan your visit!

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?
