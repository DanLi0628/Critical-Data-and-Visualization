- Simple intro:Every time people go to Disneyland, they complain about the long waiting time. Have you ever thought about what period of the year or which day in a week will attract more people? Have a look at this visualization and better plan your visit!

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- I'm inspired by Marauder's map from Harry Potter and then I determine to use the form of map to visualize the data. Also, the map form is explicit and easy to read. The graph on the third page is inspired by a coding exercise that I did this semester (the birth rate graph). 

- Visualization: Many elements are visualized in this project, including temperature, weather, day, date, the waiting time. The problem is that the style of each is not that consistent. Overall, the visualization went well though the coding process was really difficult for me.

- Crucial compromises: The disneyland character icons ought to appear by following the map path. However due to the structure of my dataset, I can only either extract all attraction data, or use them as a whole. If I separate the attractions, it would be harder to visualize the data based on "day." If I use the data as a whole, I cannot adjust the path of every icon so they cannot move along the path. For me the path problem is a big compromise, but if I chose the previous approach, the compromise might be even larger. 

- Improvements: If I were given more time, I will beautify my project to make it more like a website. Also, the styles of the buttons will be more consistent with the map. There will be more detailed information about the dataset provider aibili wu, more disneyland events and stories.
