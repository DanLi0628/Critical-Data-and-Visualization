- Simple intro:Every time people go to Disneyland, they complain about the long waiting time. Have you ever thought about what period of the year or which day in a week will attract more people? Have a look at this visualization and better plan your visit!

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?


- Crucial compromises: The disneyland character icons ought to appear by following the map path. However due to the structure of my dataset, I can only either extract all attraction data, or use them as a whole. If I separate the attractions, it would be harder to visualize the data based on "day." If I use the data as a whole, I cannot adjust the path of every icon so they cannot move along the path. For me the path problem is a big compromise, but if I chose the previous approach, the compromise might be even larger. 


- Improvements: If I were given more time, I will beautify my project to make it more like a website. Also, the styles of the buttons will be more consistent with the map. There will be more detailed information about the dataset provider aibili wu, more disneyland events and stories.
