1. This one is about memes. It contains over 80,000 memes generated online. I am the person who really likes memes. With regard to how to build a project about it, I plan to find some original meme pictures, and then roughly search how many similar memes are created (the same picture with different words). Also, I will do some research on what kinds of memes are more popular and which ones are less attractive. The popular ones will become more clear on the screen while the less popular ones will fade away gradually.

2. The second dataset is about Marvel characters, but I haven't decided to focus on their commercial values or on their characteristics/fans' love. The dataset itself is about how much values that a hero creates. To match the dataset, it would be easier for me visualize the values and the change over the past 5 or 10 years. Also, I can make a comparison between the characters from the film and from the comic books.

3. I want to make a project about Disneyland but haven't found the dataset that satisfies my needs. I want a dataset which records not only the attendance of the theme park, but also the attendance of different amusement facilities. In addition, will the weather affect the attendance (I think so!)? To visualize the data, I may mimic the data story of "birthday paradox", which has many people on the screen and is easier for readers to understand. Also, the color of the webpage will change according to the weather or season.
